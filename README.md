# Automated Scheduler

## Project Overview
The **Automated Scheduler** is designed to streamline the shift scheduling process for **SSSC (Science Student Success Centre) mentors**. This system allows mentors to submit their availability while ensuring compliance with predefined scheduling rules, such as requiring at least **three consecutive time slots twice a week**. The system provides both a **web interface** for easy access and a **role-based access control** system for administrators to manage mentor schedules.

## Problem Statement
Manual scheduling of mentor shifts is often inefficient, leading to:
- **Scheduling conflicts** due to lack of centralized availability tracking.
- **Time-consuming coordination** between mentors and administrators.
- **Inconsistent enforcement of scheduling rules**.

## Solution
The Automated Scheduler solves these issues by:
- **Providing a user-friendly web interface** for mentors to manage their availability.
- **Automating the shift scheduling process** based on mentor availability.
- **Enforcing scheduling rules** to ensure fair distribution of shifts.
- **Providing an authentication system** with admin-only access to sensitive data.
- **Implementing an intuitive API** that allows mentors to submit and update their availability easily.

## Tech Stack
This project is built using the following technologies:

### **Frontend**
- **HTML5 & CSS3** - User interface and styling
- **JavaScript** - Client-side functionality
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework

### **Backend**
- **Node.js & Express.js** - REST API development
- **MongoDB & Mongoose** - Database & ODM
- **JSON Web Token (JWT)** - Authentication & authorization
- **Bcrypt.js** - Secure password hashing
- **dotenv** - Environment variable management
- **Jest & Supertest** - Automated testing

## Features Implemented
### **Authentication & Authorization**
- Secure user authentication with **JWT-based login system**
- Role-based authorization for **admin-only routes**
- User-friendly signup and login interface

### **Mentor Availability Management**
- Mentors can **submit & update their availability** through a web interface
- Validation ensures at least **three consecutive slots on two different days**
- Admins can **view mentor data** and manage schedules
- Interactive calendar interface for availability selection

### **Scheduling System**
- Automated scheduling algorithm for fair shift distribution
- Scripts for generating and managing schedules
- Tools for seeding and managing mentor/admin accounts

### **Automated Testing**
- Unit & integration tests using **Jest & Supertest**
- Tests cover **user authentication, availability submission, and admin access**
- Frontend end-to-end tests using **Playwright** covering user flows and UI validation

## API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Description | Authentication Required |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| `/api/users/signup` | POST | Register a new mentor or admin | No |
| `/api/users/login` | POST | Authenticate user and receive a JWT token | No |
| `/api/users/admin/data` | GET | Retrieve all user data | Yes (Admin only) |
| `/api/users/availability` | POST | Submit or update mentor availability | Yes |
| `/api/users/details` | POST | Submit or update user details (major, co-op status, etc.) | Yes |
| `/api/users/profile` | GET | Get current user's profile information | Yes |

All authenticated endpoints require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.

## Testing & Validation
The project includes comprehensive testing at both frontend and backend levels:

### **Backend Testing**
- **Unit & Integration Tests** using `Jest & Supertest`.
- Tests cover **user authentication, availability submission, and admin access**.
- Run backend tests with:
  ```bash
  cd backend && npm test
  ```

### **Frontend Testing**
- The frontend is tested using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for full end-to-end coverage across all major browsers.
- Tests cover user interface functionality, including:
  - User authentication flow.
  - Availability selection and validation.
  - Form submissions and error handling.
  - Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
